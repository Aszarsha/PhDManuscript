\section{Full Th17 module tables}
\label{app:details}

We provide a tabular overview of the module contents (\cref{fig:table2h} and \cref{fig:table48h}).
In the tables, each row lists unmatched genes or homologuous gene pairs with their activity scores.
On the left side are the mouse genes and on the right side the human genes.
The gene activity scores are in parentheses.
Names in bold represent genes for which no homologous counterpart exist in the underlying networks.

Note that very few (overall only 2 in mouse for \unit{48}{h}) genes with negative activity score and without conserved counterpart are selected.
Some of them even have a strong positive activity score.
These genes would be missed in a strict conservation model.% , which also suggests that a strict
% module conservation between the two species is too stringent to fully explain
% these data.
