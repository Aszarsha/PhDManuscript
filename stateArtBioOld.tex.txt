\section{Genes detection, genes selection}

	A gene, in itself, is but a sequence located at a specific region on the DNA of an organism.
	XXX we don't measure the transcription reaction / RNA polymeration directly XXX.
	The ability to measuring gene expression levels requires first and foremost the capacity to measure their byproducts.
	\Cref{subsec:measuregenes} treat of the measurement techniques of those genes byproducts.

	In \cref{subsec:diffanalysis} we present the most important methods that are based on this ability to measure the state of a cell at its biomolecular level.

	\subsection{Measuring genes expression}
	\label{subsec:measuregenes}

	In 1956, \textcite{berson1956insulin}, for which Rosalyn S. Yalow receiced multiple awards including the Nobel Prize of Medicine in 1977 \parencite{SJI:SJI21}, introduced the radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique.
	At the time they used their technique to measure the rate of insulin metabolic \emph{in vitro} degradation using the radioactively-labeled insulin-I$^{131}$ as a competitive proxy.
	There were techniques that allowed to test for the presence of a specific analyte, but the novelty in their approch is that it allowed them to take quantitative measurements of the biomolecules.

	XXX However those methods are not multiplexable (measure up to million of analytes) -> limit the analysis of whole cells.
	Introduce microarrays and seq. XXX

	\subsubsection{Microarrays}

	In the last two decades, the large adoption of \emph{microarray} technologies have dramatically changed the landscape of biology and biomedical research.
	Microarray technologies are high-throughput screening methods for biological material, that allow experimenters to assay the amount the quantity of a specific material on a large scale.
	Where previous assey methods were rate limited, non-parallelizable and seldom multiplexable\footnote{Some are considered low-plex (in the order of ten analytes) or mid-plex (in the order of hendred or thousands of analytes), which is not enough to capture the whole transcriptome state of a cell.}, modern microarrays allows for many multiple materials to be screened for and quantified in parallel.
	Previous methods also usually involved human interaction and only enabled to screen for a small number of targets, whereas microarray are typically the size of a microscope slide yet allow to screen up to or more than ten thousand different targets\footnote{The very first microarray introduced were screening for a maximum of 400 antigens \parencite{chang1983binding}.} \parencites{smyth2005use}{sealfon2011rna}, are more sensitive, and can be automated.
	This ability to quantify many molecular targets in parallel led to a whole new level of understanding of complex biological processes.

	There exists many different kinds of microarray, for different biological material, some screening for very specific molecules, and some much more general in their targets.
	Amino-acid sequences microarray are an important kind of microarray; and the first to be introduced.
	\Textcite{chang1983binding} realised that he could create a bidimensional array of sequence probes that allows him to screen for antigens by assessing the capture of target antigens inside antibodies controlled spots.
	This allowed him to detect the recognized antibodies of antigens bearing cells\footnote{Its \emph{allotype}.}, and more importantly to quantify the proportion and types of many different kinds of those cells in a sample of mixed population in parallel.
	He latter developed the microarray concept in a series of patents \parencites{chang1986matrix}{chang1989immunoassay}{chang1992antibody} which led to a whole new industry.

	XXX Talk briefly about RNA expression microarrays (REM) ??? XXX

	But by far the most widely used type of microarray is the \emph{DNA microarray}\footnote{Also known as \emph{DNA chip}.} that screen for both DNA or RNA sequences \parencite{sealfon2011rna}.
	They evolved from \emph{DNA blotting}\footnote{Also known as \emph{Southern blotting}.} techniques introduced by \textcite{southern1975detection}, where DNA fragments are first separated then selectively hybridized by probes\footnote{Which is the opposite operation of microarrays where the probes are fixed and the screened for medium is applied on the chip.}.
	Two decades ago, \textcite{schena1995quantitative} used robotic printing to prepare microarrays plates with PCR amplified complementary DNA (\emph{cDNA}) probes\footnote{\label{ft:invterm}Note that they use the opposite of the usual terminilogy in their paper: the targets are on the plate and it is the probes that are made fluorescent and are hybridized.} sequences from \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana}.
	They then hybridized fluorescent targets\footref{ft:invterm} made from reverse transcription of \emph{Arabidopsis}' mRNA at high stringency.
	Using high-precision laser to excite the hybridized fluorescent markers, they used those microarrays for quantitatively measuring the levels of the corresponding genes' \emph{mRNA}.

	This technology has been for a long time the gold standard to capture the state of a cell.
	Indeed, it is a cost-efficient and fast method to assess genes expression levels \emph{at genome wide resolution}.
	It allowed the accumulation of large-scale experimental data, which led to a lot of research aimed at understanding the complex biomolecular mechanisms of organisms.
	As soon as 2000, Booth et al. said of DNA microarrays that they were "\emph{hailed as the ultimate experimental tool for research, drug discovery and diagnostics}" \parencite{booth2000application}.

	However, DNA microarray technologies are not a panacea, and they present quite a few technical challenges in themselves.

	\subsubsection{Sequencing}

	\Textcite{marioni2008rna} showed that RNA-seq is more accurate than expression microarrays when larger differences in gene expression levels are present. \Textcite{fu2009estimating} reproced the results with proteomics controls.
